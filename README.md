# Description

A personal portfolio showcasing my web development work.
For this portfolio I have used HTML and CSS to create and style my page.
I have created links on the page which direct the user to my GitHub page showcasing the project.
I have also added links which take you directly to my Github, LinkedIn Profile and Email if you would like to contact me.
